# Project Overview

## What I Learned
This project explores a single page layout with animations and clickable links. This is my second time building a website with HTML/CSS, the first being a business card page. This is the first project that consisted of variable fonts and animations. It was a very complex site to create, with many colors and background shapes.

## Problem Solving and Accessibility
I tried to make this site easy to understand, navigate, and read, as there high contrasting colors, and simple Arial fonts for the paragraph bits. While not exactly solving a problem, it does easily showcase the variable possibilities of the Nickel Gothic font.

## Features, Fonts, Designs, Mock-ups
My intense color palette, consistent design, and animations make this site stand out. I used Nickel Gothic Variable as my font, with a basic Arial for the smaller text. The large, intense feel of the font led to the large, intense feel of the site's shapes and colors. I pulled color inspiration from a 70s Firebird, as the font reminds me of cars and car ads from the same time. My mockups were created in Adobe Illustrator.
